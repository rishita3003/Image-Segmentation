# Image-Segmentation
 Involves the use of U-Net, a CNN architecture, specially designed for semantic segmentation tasks. Objective of this project is to improve accuracy of image segmentation .  The model is built from scratch by creating a U-Net architechture and then training the model with a dataset from kaggle and then backpropagation using pytorch libraries.
